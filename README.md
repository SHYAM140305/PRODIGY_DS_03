Decision Tree Classifier of Banking Dataset

This project focuses on creating a decision tree classifier for the banking dataset obtained from UCI Repository. The Banking dataset provides data on the various customers that visited the bank in order to secure loan services.

The data from the dataset is used to create a decision tree classifier that can be used to predict whether a customer will be able to secure loan from the bank.

The code is written in the python programming language using the python libraries matplotlib, numpy, sklearn, category_encoders and pandas.
